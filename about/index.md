Hi. I'm a software maker from [Townsville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville), Australia. I have a deep interest in user experience, especially on the web.  Someone in Townsville got ADSL last year, so I've finally been able to build a [few web projects](/projects).

Currently I spend most of my time working on eResearch projects with university researchers, but I keep some time spare for technology consulting and other side projects.

If you want to discuss a project, an article, or some consulting, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@danielbaird.com).
