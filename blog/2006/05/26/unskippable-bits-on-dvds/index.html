<div class="entry-content"><p>DVDs often stop me from fast-forwarding through the stuff that plays before the movie, and that sucks.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD#DVD-Video">Apparently</a> this is an example of User Operation Prohibitions, or UOPs.  I&#8217;m forced to sit through studio branding, copyright warnings, government ads telling me that &#8220;piracy is stealing&#8221;, and even the frickin&#8217; animations that introduce the menu.</p>

<p>What is the point of this?  The movie studio must have some good reasons for preventing viewers from skipping those parts.  Here&#8217;s some reasons I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>by forcing me to watch the studio branding bit, where the camera zooms around inside some indistinguishable object, and eventually pulls back, revealing the object to be a big horse or a tree or something.. the studio is marketing itself to me.</li>
</ul>


<p>Okay, but what&#8217;s actually happening here is that the DVD I just bought is showing me the logo of a particular movie studio, and <em>simultaneously pissing me off</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>by forcing me to watch a stupid ad where some Young Person is downloading a movie off the web, and cutting in scenes of people stealing cars and handbags and whatnot, and eventually showing the Young Person cancelling the download whilst telling me that &#8220;piracy is stealing&#8221;, I&#8217;m less likely to watch pirated movies.</li>
</ul>


<p>Firstly, why does the ad show someone downloading a movie?  <em>I&#8217;ve already got the movie, I&#8217;m watching it right now</em> (or I would be, if I could skip over this crap).  Surely it would be more useful to show someone not copying their DVD for their friends, rather than not downloading it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the people who are downloading movies already know that it&#8217;s illegal.  It doesn&#8217;t help that the ad is trying to draw a parallel between copying movies and stealing cars, because apart from both being illegal, they&#8217;re quite obviously different things.  Copyright infringement is bad, but <a href="http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/5002/theft.html">it&#8217;s arguable</a> whether it&#8217;s &#8220;stealing&#8221; at all; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft">most definitions of theft</a> involve depriving the rightful owner of possession of the item.</p>

<p>There is one thing the ad does pretty well; if it hadn&#8217;t occurred to someone that they could download movies from the web, they sure know it now.  So at least it&#8217;s educational.</p>

<ul>
<li>by forcing me to look at the copyright/FBI warning for 60 seconds, I might pay more attention to the information presented there.</li>
</ul>


<p>Nnnnnnnope.  Who reads that stuff?  No-one, doesn&#8217;t matter how long you leave it up on screen.</p>

<p>The only reason it is there is so if the studio want to charge someone with copyright infringement (or whatever it&#8217;s called in the US now since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA">DMCA</a>.. it&#8217;s probably been renamed &#8220;treason against America&#8221; or something), the defendant can&#8217;t claim that they never knew it was against the law.  Okay, that&#8217;s a good reason to have it there, but <em>why stop me from skipping it</em>?</p>

<ul>
<li>The little intro animation as the menu scrolls into view are, um, cute.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is the best I can come up with, because there&#8217;s <em>no reason on earth</em> to have the menu intro unskippable.  My daughter watches Fairytopia five times a day!  Do I have to watch Fairy Barbie flutter around the screen for thirty seconds every Fairy Freakin&#8217; time?</p>

<p>Stuart Little is even worse; even when the menu is completely showing and appears ready to use, you still have to wait for Stuart to finish saying something like &#8220;Hi there.  Hope you enjoy the movie&#8221; before you can hit the Play Movie button.</p>

<p>While &#8220;researching&#8221; this article, I discovered that (according to Wikipedia) grey market DVD players often ignore UOPs, and let you skip whatever you like.  So I&#8217;m off shopping today for a grey market DVD player.  See what you&#8217;ve done, movie studio DVD divisons?  You&#8217;ve forced me go and buy a player that ignores region coding and all that other stuff, just to be able to skip the pre-movie crap.</p>

<p>Not being able to skip pre-movie stuff sucks.</p>
