CliMAS is a group of three web tools presenting information about climate change and species adaptation.  I joined the CliMAS project in late 2012, when the CliMAS projects were all due to be finished, but weren't.  They came together and ended up alright.

h2. CliMAS Reports

One tool, CliMAS Reports, I implemented from scratch in Ruby and Javascript.  It would take climate and biodiversity data in JSON format and use it to generate a nice printable report for the region you selected.  "Lauren Hodgson":https://github.com/LaurenHodgson put the data together and wrote the conditional report text using the little "Report Assembler":{{ site.baseurl }}projects/report-assembler I wrote for this project.

The report assembly all happens in browser, and I used a print stylesheet to make the final report printable directly.

h2. CliMAS Suitability and CliMAS Biodiversity

The other two CliMAS tools, CliMAS Suitability and CliMAS Biodiversity, were partly implemented in PHP, and needed me to finish off the back end and hook up a UI.  I used "Leaflet":http://leafletjs.com/ for the map-displaying parts of these tools, and re-used a lot of the UI elements I made for CliMAS Reports.

Time pressure was quite high on these and I don't love everything about the final results, but I did manage to meet the project goals and get a nice consistent look across all three tools.
