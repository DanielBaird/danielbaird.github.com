summary: "In late 2012 \"Lauren\":https://github.com/LaurenHodgson and I built a report generator that takes environmental and biodiversity data (in JSON) and turns it into a lovely printable text report.  The whole thing turned out rather well, and left me with a nice little conditional text assembly library in JavaScript."
