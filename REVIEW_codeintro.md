My adventures in and reflections on Commodore 64 BASIC, C, C++, Delphi (don't laugh, Delphi was awesome), a smattering of Visual Basic, Java, XML and XSLT, Ruby, JavaScript and CoffeeScript, HTML and CSS, and a few domain languages I've invented.

Actually the new languages were mostly NDA'ed.  So forget I said anything.
