In 2012 the eResearch Centre at JCU started a project to do four things:

* source and show australian bird observations on a web map
* let visitors "vet" those observations (in the sense of detecting and deleting the incorrect ones)
* determine the species' preferred climate conditions, using the clean set of observations and information about Australia's existing climate
* determine where the species' preferred climate niche will be in the future, using climate models to project future climate, and matching that to species' preferences.

Our partly-tame academics Jeremy VanDerWal and Lauren Hodgson provided the modelling algorithms, "The Amazing Rob":https://github.com/robertpyke did server stuff and arranged for the modelling to happen on-demand, and "Tom":https://github.com/tomdalling handled the data side.  I did most of the user interface, which has a few interesting bits:
* crowdsourcing of the observation cleaning bit
* stretching the map across the whole screen (sure, it's been done before, but it was fun doing it with OpenLayers and making it not suck).

It's called Edgar because it was about ravens (and other birds..), and the project code was @AP03@.  EdgarAPO3 ~ Edgar A. Poe, geddit?
